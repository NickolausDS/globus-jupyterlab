Welcome to globus-jupyterlab's documentation!
=============================================

Globus Jupyterlab is an extension to Jupyterlab for easily submitting Globus Transfers
within a running lab environment. Integration within the Jupyterlab filemanager makes
starting transfers just a few clicks away!

The extension is installable via pip and is suitable for both local environments such
as a workmachine or laptop, or alternatively on top of a Single User Server when running
in a hub environment like `Zero-to-Jupyterhub <https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
