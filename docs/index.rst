Welcome to Globus-JupyterLab's documentation!
=============================================

Globus Jupyterlab is an extension to JupyterLab for submitting Globus Transfers
within a running JupyterLab environment. The integration enables the user to initiate a Globus transfer from within the JupyterLab file manager.

The extension is installable via pip and is suitable for both local environments such
as a workmachine or laptop, or, alternatively, on top of a Single User Server when running
in a JupyterHub environment like `Zero-to-JupyterHub <https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
