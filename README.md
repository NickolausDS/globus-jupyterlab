# jupyterlab_globus

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gneezyn/jupyterlab_globus/master?urlpath=lab)

Jupyterlab Extension that incorporates Globus functionality.

## Setup & Developer Guides
To avoid confusion, the setup instructions and developer information have been moved to the **docs** folder. Please see the following list for the file that best fits your purpose.

* [Binder Setup](docs/setups/binder_setup.md) - setup instructions for the Binder repo version
    * Recommended for practical use and users familiar with the extension.
* [Local Setup](docs/setups/local_setup.md) - setup instructions for the local version
    * Recommended for first-time users and for developers
* [Development Relevant Info](docs/develop/) - contains information about this extension that is meant for anyone wanting to further develop this extension

## Notes
* The Globus Connect Personal feature has been temporarily deleted due to compatibility issues. A later version will support it. Instead of using the convenient Globus Connect Personal file browser from the Globus extension, use the default JupyterLab file browser.
* At this time, the published version of this extension is an older version that no longer works.
